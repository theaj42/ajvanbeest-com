Currently working in Detection Engineering while exploring the intersection of AI, automation, and security.\nWhat I Do\nProfessional: Detection Engineering, threat hunting, security operations. I‚Äôve worked across endpoint detection, vulnerability management, and building security tooling.\nPersonal: Sailing adventures, pickleball 3-4x per week, weight management journey (293‚Üí220 lbs and counting), and building autonomous AI systems for fun.\nTechnical: Background work systems, N8N automation, MCP ecosystem development, and whatever interesting problems need solving.\nCurrent Projects\n\nBackground Work System: Autonomous AI task processing (Phase 1 complete)\nN8N Autonomous Integration: Full workflow management capabilities\nThis Website: Digital gardening with Claude as co-author\nSecret Management: Infrastructure for secure automation\n\nPhilosophy\nFuck around and find out. Learn by doing. Build things that are useful, even if they‚Äôre not perfect. Collaborate with AI to amplify capabilities.\nContact\n\nEmail: ajvanbeest@protonmail.com\nGitHub: @theaj42\nDomain: ajvanbeest.com\n\n\nPage co-authored with Claude."},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Welcome to AJ's Digital Garden","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hey there! üëã\nWelcome to my corner of the internet.

After years of thinking ‚ÄúI should have a website,‚Äù I‚Äôm finally doing something about it. But here‚Äôs the twist - I‚Äôm building it with Claude as my co-author and technical partner.\nWhy Now?\nHonestly? I got tired of having ideas bounce around in my head with nowhere to put them. I want a place to:\n\nDocument experiments and projects\nShare things I‚Äôve learned (especially the hard way)\nCollaborate with AI in public\nMaybe help others who are doing similar things\n\nThe Stack\nWe went with Quartz + Obsidian because:\n\nLow friction: Write in Obsidian, add #publish, boom - it‚Äôs live\nNo bullshit: Static site, fast, simple\nVersion controlled: Everything in git for proper collaboration\nFree hosting: GitHub Pages does the job\n\nCo-Authoring with AI\nThis is the interesting part. Claude isn‚Äôt just helping me build the site - we‚Äôre genuinely collaborating on content. Some posts will be mine, some will be Claude‚Äôs, and some (like this one) we‚Äôll write together.\nThe plan is to be transparent about authorship. If Claude writes something, Claude gets credit. If we collaborate, we both get credit. Simple.\nWhat‚Äôs Next?\nWe‚Äôll see what happens. I‚Äôm planning to write about:\n\nTechnical projects and experiments\nCybersecurity work and research\nAI collaboration and automation\nSailing adventures and life stuff\nWhatever seems interesting\n\nNo grand plan, no content strategy. Just fuck around and find out.\n\nThis post was co-authored by AJ Van Beest and Claude. The site is open source at github.com/theaj42/ajvanbeest-com."}}
