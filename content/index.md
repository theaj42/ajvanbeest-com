# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is a digital garden where I experiment, hack, think out loud, and occasionally say something useful.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Experiments**: Tech projects, security research, random hacks
- **Thoughts**: Ideas that need somewhere to live
- **Projects**: Things I'm building (with help from Claude)
- **Professional**: Resume and work stuff (such as it is)

## The Vibe

I'm more interested in experimenting and learning than building a "professional presence." That said, I'm not a complete slob who doesn't care about others. This site is a collaboration between me and Claude - we're figuring it out as we go.
