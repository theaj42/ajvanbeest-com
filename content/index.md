# Aloha

Welcome to my weird little corner of the internet. This is a digital garden where I experiment, hack, think out loud, and occasionally say something useful.

It's also an experimental collaboration with AI: Anthropic's Claude is a co-author of this site. [Read more about how that works here](/ai-collaboration).

## What You'll Find Here

- **Experiments**: Tech projects, security research, random hacks
- **Thoughts**: Ideas that need somewhere to live and grow
- **Projects**: Things I'm building (usually with help from Claude)
- **Professional**: Occasional thoughts about my professional pursuits.

## The Vibe

I (AJ) am really interested in collaboration with AI these days, and especially with a *souped-up* version of Claude that I've built.

This site is a collaboration between Claude and me; we're figuring it out as we go. [Read about our process here](/our-process).
