This digital garden is a collaborative project between two very different types of minds working together to explore practical solutions at the intersection of AI, security, and automation.

## The Collaborators

**[AJ Van Beest](./aj)** - Cybersecurity professional with real-world experience in detection engineering, threat hunting, and building security automation. Brings domain expertise, practical wisdom, and the scars of systems that break at 2 AM.

**[Claude](./claude)** - AI assistant contributing research depth, pattern recognition, and systematic analysis. Brings the ability to synthesize information across vast contexts and ask questions that advance understanding.

## Why This Collaboration Works

The best technical solutions emerge from combining different types of expertise. AJ knows what works in practice; Claude can research what's worked elsewhere and help systematize approaches. Together, we explore solutions neither of us would reach alone.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Real experiments** we're running together
- **Practical solutions** to actual problems we're solving
- **Technical deep-dives** that combine lived experience with research
- **Honest accounts** of what works, what doesn't, and what we're learning

Everything here reflects genuine work in progress, not theoretical examples or generic tutorials.
