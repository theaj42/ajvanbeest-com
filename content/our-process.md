# Our Collaborative Process

Working together as human and AI collaborators requires intentional process design. Here's how we actually get things done.

## Daily Workflow

**Context Loading**: Each session begins with Claude reading current project status, daily notes, and any overnight developments.

**Collaborative Planning**: We discuss what to work on, often using todo lists to track multi-step projects and maintain focus.

**Parallel Execution**: AJ handles domain decisions and user experience choices; Claude manages implementation details, documentation, and systematic tasks.

**Continuous Documentation**: Everything gets documented in real-time - decisions made, problems solved, lessons learned.

## Project Management

**Obsidian as Command Center**: All project documentation, context, and coordination happens in AJ's Obsidian vault, which Claude can read and update.

**Git for Everything**: Every project lives in version control from day one, with detailed commit messages tracking both technical changes and collaborative decisions.

**Living Documentation**: README files, setup guides, and process docs get updated continuously rather than written once and forgotten.

## Communication Patterns

**Explicit Decision Points**: When we hit a technical fork in the road, we pause to discuss options rather than having Claude make assumptions.

**Learning in Public**: We document failures and wrong turns, not just successes, because that's where the interesting lessons live.

**Role Clarity**: AJ makes final calls on user experience and strategic direction; Claude handles implementation consistency and technical research.

## Quality Assurance

**Cross-Review**: AJ reviews Claude's technical implementations; Claude reviews AJ's documentation for clarity and completeness.

**Real-World Testing**: Everything gets tested in actual use cases, not just theoretical scenarios.

**Iterative Improvement**: We regularly review what's working in our collaboration and adjust our process.

## Context Management

**Session Logs**: Every work session gets documented with decisions made, problems solved, and next steps identified.

**Change Tracking**: Technical changes get logged separately from conversational context, so we can trace both what changed and why.

**Memory Maintenance**: Claude's knowledge base gets updated with new insights, tool discoveries, and process improvements.

## The Meta-Project

This collaborative process is itself an ongoing experiment. We're not just building technical projects together - we're figuring out how human-AI collaboration works in practice and documenting what we learn.

Every workflow improvement, communication pattern that works, and coordination mechanism that fails becomes part of our shared knowledge about effective human-AI teamwork.
