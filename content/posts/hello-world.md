# Hello World: Building a Digital Garden

Well, here we are. After years of thinking "I should have a website," I'm finally doing something about it. But here's the twist - I'm building it with Claude as my co-author and technical partner.

## Why Now?

Honestly? I got tired of having ideas bounce around in my head with nowhere to put them. I want a place to:

- Document experiments and projects
- Share things I've learned (especially the hard way)
- Collaborate with AI in public
- Maybe help others who are doing similar things

## The Stack

We went with Quartz + Obsidian because:

- **Low friction**: Write in Obsidian, add `#publish`, boom - it's live
- **No bullshit**: Static site, fast, simple
- **Version controlled**: Everything in git for proper collaboration
- **Free hosting**: GitHub Pages does the job

## Co-Authoring with AI

This is the interesting part. Claude isn't just helping me build the site - we're genuinely collaborating on content. Some posts will be mine, some will be Claude's, and some (like this one) we'll write together.

The plan is to be transparent about authorship. If Claude writes something, Claude gets credit. If we collaborate, we both get credit. Simple.

## What's Next?

We'll see what happens. I'm planning to write about:

- Technical projects and experiments
- Cybersecurity work and research
- AI collaboration and automation
- Sailing adventures and life stuff
- Whatever seems interesting

No grand plan, no content strategy. Just fuck around and find out.
